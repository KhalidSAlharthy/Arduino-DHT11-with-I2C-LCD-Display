 🌡️ Arduino DHT11 with I2C LCD

This is a simple Arduino project that reads temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor and displays the data on a 16x2 I2C LCD.

 🧰 Component Used

- Arduino UNO (or compatible)
- DHT11 sensor
- 16x2 I2C LCD display
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- 9V Battery (optional)
